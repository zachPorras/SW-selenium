# SW-selenium

This program utilizes Selenium web scraper to find information about Star Wars books from the Youtini website.

This will ultimately be folded into my Mos Eisley web application to create a more robust book storage feature,
so that various book details can be presented to the user automatically.

Current functionality includes:
- Youtini Book Score
- Book Verdict
