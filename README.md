# SW-selenium

This program utilizes Selenium web scraper to find information about Star Wars books from the Youtini website.

This will ultimately be folded into my sw_blog web application to create a more robust book storage feature,
so that various book details can be presented to the user automatically.

Current functionality includes:
- Youtini book score
